# originOS Flow

Origin is a simulated desktop environment, that runs on scratch and an interpreted programing language. OSL allows for powerful and modular programming through text inside of the turbowarp engine. The main purpose of origin is to allow for installing, running and programming applications from entirely within the os itself with no need to edit the source code itself. Origin and the OSL engine create a powerful and fast desktop environment that takes advantage of as many optimisations as it can to gain optimal frame rates. OSL is by far the biggest drain on framerate and is what weighs the system down with over 80% of processing time being used up by the osl interpreter. The statement system is a big contributer to the render times, and uses a stack like system to track the current scope of the osl program.
